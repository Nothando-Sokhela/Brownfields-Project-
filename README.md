Welcome to the Brownfields project, a collaborative endeavor aimed at enhancing the popular Robot World game through iterative development and modern software engineering practices.

Project Overview:

The Brownfields project, conducted as part of the Brownfields Development module at WeThinkCode_, focused on improving an existing codebase in Java while simulating real-world software delivery cycles. Students worked in teams to implement new features, optimize processes, and overcome challenges within the Robot World game environment.


Iterations:

Acceptance Testing:
  Implemented quality assurance processes to ensure the game meets end users' approval.
  Conducted rigorous testing to identify and address any issues or bugs.

Build Pipeline:
  Established automated processes for compiling, building, and deploying code reliably and efficiently.
  Streamlined the development workflow to enhance productivity.

Persistence:
  Managed data storage in a relational database to enhance the game's functionality.
  Implemented database systems to store user data and game configurations.
  
	
Simple HTTP API:
  Developed a basic server automation tool to control the game from external applications using simple HTTP calls.
  Improved accessibility and integration capabilities of the game.

Separation of Concerns: Design for Change:
  Implemented a modular and scalable design to separate application concerns.
  Enhanced maintainability and flexibility for future iterations and updates.

Technologies Used:

Languages: Java

Tools: Maven,Makefile, Docker, Git
  
Frameworks: Spring Boot (for HTTP API)
  
Database: SQLite (for persistence)
  
Testing: JUnit

Version Control: GitLab

Challenges Faced:
  Understanding Someone else's Code: Navigating and understanding the complexities of the existing codebase presented initial challenges but was overcome through collaborative effort and thorough analysis.
  Integration and Deployment: Integrating new features seamlessly and ensuring smooth deployment required careful planning and coordination, but was facilitated by the use of Docker containers and continuous integration pipelines.
  Maintaining Code Quality: Ensuring code quality and adherence to best practices throughout the development process required ongoing vigilance and regular code reviews and using tools such as Codescene.
